## POINTS TO NOTE:
* In Linux, files have different permissions or file modes. You can check out the permissions of a file or directory using ls -l.
```
hacker@dojo:~$ mkdir pwn_directory
hacker@dojo:~$ touch college_file
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker    0 May 22 13:42 college_file
drwxr-xr-x 2 hacker hacker 4096 May 22 13:42 pwn_directory
hacker@dojo:~$
```
* The first character of each line represents the file type. In pwn_directory's case, the d indicates that it's a directory, and in college_file's case, the - represents that it's a normal file.
* The next nine characters are the actual access permissions of the file or directory, split into 3 characters denoting the permissions that the user who owns the file (termed the "owner") has to the file, 3 characters denoting the permissions that the group that owns the file (termed the "group") has to the file, and 3 characters denoting the permissions that all other access (e.g., by other users and other groups) has to the file.
