*After finding the backdoor and making your way to the next floor, you step into a chamber awash with shifting colors and swirling echoes, a concert frozen in time. Kevin Parker stands at the center, his riffs bending reality around him. To ascend, youâ€™ll need to join the session on his terms: push your voice further than comfort, align yourself with the number he hides in the haze, and piece together the melody concealed within layers of reverb. Only then will the music open the way upward.*
