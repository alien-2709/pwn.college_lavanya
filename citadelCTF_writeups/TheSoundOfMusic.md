*ðŸ—¼OSINT pt2: citadweller had a newfound interest in tracking the music they last listened to and posting ratings of new albums on various online platforms.*  

*The flag is hidden in these digital footprints across music platforms and split into three segments. You will need to find all three to uncover the complete code and move on to the next floor.*  

## What I did:
* Using the hint , that the flag is hidden among three segments that involves listening to music, tracking the music they listened to and rating of new albums, I browsed through the various platforms for the username ```citadweller``` and found different parts of the flag.  
### SPOTIFY:
+ ```flag part iii.: _n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und} ``` 

### LASTFM:
+ In the shoutbox of *last.fm/user/citadweller*:```flag part i: citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n```

### RATEYOURMUSIC:  
+  ```flag part ii : _n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es```

+ Therefore complete flag as obtained is:
  ```citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n_n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es_n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und}```
